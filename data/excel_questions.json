    "expected_answer_description": "A relative cell reference (e.g., A1) changes when a formula is copied to other cells. For example, if =A1+B1 is in C1 and copied to C2, it becomes =A2+B2. This is the default behavior and is useful when you want to apply the same logic to different rows or columns of data.\n\nAn absolute cell reference (e.g., $A$1) remains fixed when a formula is copied. The dollar signs lock the row and/or column. This is used when a formula needs to always refer to a specific cell, like a fixed exchange rate, a tax rate, or a constant value that shouldn't change when the formula is moved.",

Drag fields to the appropriate areas (Rows, Columns, Values, Filters).\n\n**Purpose of the 'Values' area:**\nThe 'Values' area is where you place numerical fields that you want to summarize or aggregate (e.g., sum, count, average, max, min). When you drag a field here, Excel automatically applies a default aggregation function (usually SUM for numbers, COUNT for text). Its purpose is to perform calculations on the data and display the results in the PivotTable.",

For example, looking up a product name (lookup value) in a product catalog (table array) to retrieve its price (column index number) or description.\n\n**VLOOKUP Limitations:**\n1. Left-to-Right Only: It can only look up values in the leftmost column of the table array and return values from columns to its right.\n2. Column Insertion/Deletion Issues: If columns are inserted or deleted within the table array, the col_index_num argument needs to be manually updated, which can break formulas.\n3. Exact Match Confusion: While it has range_lookup, many users inadvertently use approximate match or get confused, leading to incorrect results if exact match isn't explicitly specified.\n\n**Modern Function to Overcome Limitations:**\nXLOOKUP is the modern successor to VLOOKUP (and HLOOKUP). It overcomes VLOOKUP's limitations by:\n- Bi-directional Search: It can look up values to the left or right.\n- No Column Index: It uses separate lookup_array and return_array arguments, making it immune to column insertions/deletions.\n- Exact Match Default: Its default match_mode is exact match, reducing errors.\n- Other features: It also handles approximate matches, wildcard characters, searching in reverse, and returning an \"if not found\" value directly.",
