Overall: 2.0/5 (Needs Improvement)
- EXL001: The candidate correctly identifies and explains the behavior of relative and absolute cell references when copied.  The examples provided are appropriate and illustrate the practical application of each. However, the explanation lacks the nuance of explaining how to create mixed references (e.g., $A1 or A$1), which would allow for locking only the row or column. This omission slightly reduces the score.
- EXL002: The candidate's steps to create a PivotTable are mostly correct but lack the precision of specifying data range selection and the 'Create PivotTable' dialog box.  The explanation of the 'Values' area is accurate and includes examples of common aggregations, but could benefit from explicitly mentioning that the default aggregation can be changed.  Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding but lacks some detail for a perfect score.
- EXL003: The candidate responded with "i dont know", demonstrating no knowledge of using Conditional Formatting in Excel to highlight values above average.  They did not provide any steps or show understanding of the functionality.
- EXL004: The candidate did not provide any answer, demonstrating a lack of understanding of VLOOKUP and its limitations.  No scenario was described, no limitations were identified, and no alternative function was suggested.
